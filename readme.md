## How to Add Music

1. Navigate to `src/data/album/`
2. Create a new folder for your album (example: `my-album`)
3. Add the audio tracks and a `cover.png` image to this folder
4. Create an `infos.json` file in the same folder with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Album Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "cover": "cover.png",
  "tracks": [
    { "title": "Track 1", "file": "track1.mp3", "duration": "3:21" },
    { "title": "Track 2", "file": "track2.mp3", "duration": "4:05" }
  ]
}
```

5. Open `src/data/album.json` and add your new folder name to the array:

```json
["album1", "album2", "your-album"]
```

6. Reload the web player. Your new album should now appear in the library.

For a step-by-step visual guide, see `upload.html`.
